Bot Description: GEEKS Mentor Group Bot

Welcome to the GEEKS_mentor_backend_Bot! ü§ñ

Are you a mentor at GEEKS educational institution? This bot is designed exclusively for you. It helps facilitate the process of handling student assistance requests and distributing them among mentors based on their designated teaching month.

Key Features:
- Seamlessly manage assistance requests from students
- Distribute requests among mentors according to their teaching month
- Collaborate effectively within the mentor community

How It Works:   
Mentors register their availability and teaching month.
When a student requires assistance, they can submit a request to the bot.
The bot randomly selects an available mentor from the corresponding teaching month.
The selected mentor receives the student's request and can either accept or decline.
If accepted, the mentor assists the student; if declined, the bot selects another mentor.
Stay connected and streamline your mentorship experience with the GEEKS Mentor Group Bot. Helping students has never been easier!

Join us and be a part of the collaborative mentor community at GEEKS. üéìü§ù
